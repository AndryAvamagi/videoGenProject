Developed a web application to generate text-to-speech videos with subtitles, providing an accessible and engaging way to convert text content into multimedia presentations. I deployed the app using docker. I configured 2 containers within a Ubuntu virtual machine to simulate front-end and back-end. 

Future plans: 
I would like find a better text-to-speech api. The current gTTS (google) does not sound good (cant complain, it is free).

You can access the app via http://165.232.120.81:3000/

Hope you like it!
