Developed a web application to generate text-to-speech videos with subtitles, providing an accessible and engaging way to convert text content into multimedia presentations. I deployed the app using docker. I configured 2 containers within a Ubuntu virtual machine to simulate front-end and back-end. 

You can access the app via http://165.232.120.81:3000/

Hope you like it!
